###  Reviewed Papers

#### **Learning to Collaborate: Multi-Scenario Ranking via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**. Jun Feng, Heng Li, Minlie Huang, Shichen Liu, Wenwu Ou, Zhirong Wang, Xiaoyan Zhu. WWW 2018. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06260.pdf)
- Multi-scenario ranking as a fully cooperative, partially observable, multi-agent sequential decision
problem. 
- Propose a novel model named Multi-Agent Recurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient (MA-RDPG) which has a communication component for passing messages, several private actors (agents) for making actions for ranking, and a centralized critic for evaluating the overall performance of the co-working actors.
- Agents are collaborate with each other by sending the global action-value function and passing messages that encodes historical information across scenarios. Each ranking strategy in one scenario is treated as agent. Each agent takes local observations
(user behavior data) and makes local actions for ranking items with its private actor network. . Different agents share a global critic network to enable them to accomplish the same goal collaboratively. The critic network evaluates the future overall rewards starting from a current state and taking actions. The agents communicate with each other by sending messages. 
- Collaborative optimization of the key metrics (CTR, GMV, CVR) 
- Model evaluation results on Taobao data
- The environment is partially observable, and each agent only receives a local observation instead of observing the full state of the environment
- In multi-agent settings the state of the environment is global, shared by all agents while the observation, the action and the intermediate reward are all private, only processed by the agent itself.
- *Communication component* The message encodes the local observation and a message from the environment. The component generates the next message based on the previous message and observation. For this purpose the LSTM architecture is applied.

- *Private actor* Action is defined as a vector of a real values . 
- Behavioral data pattern:
  - Main search ranks the relevant items when a user issues a query through the search box in the entrance page of the E-commerce
platform.
  - In-shop search ranks items in a certain shop when a user browse product at a shop's page. 
  - Users constantly navigate cross the two scenarios. When an user find a dress that she likes in the main search, she may go into the shop site for more similar products. When the user finds that the clothes in the shop are too limited, the user may go back to the main search for more products from other shops

| Scenario       | Feature           | Description                                                                                              |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Main search    | CTR               | An CTR estimation using logistic regression, considering features of users, items and their interactions |
| Main search    | Rating Score      | Average user ratings on a certain item                                                                   |
| Main search    | Search popularity | Popularity of the item shop                                                                              |
| In-shop search | Latest Collection | Whether an item is the latest collection or new arrivals of the shop                                     |
| In-shop search | Sales volume      | Sales volume of an in-shop item                                                                          |

- Environment - online E-commerce platform
- Agents - one is search engine for main search and the other is in-shop search. At each step, one of the search engines returned a ranked list of products according to the ranking algorithm. The two agents work together to maximize the overall performance
- States are partially observable. 
- To rank items, the ranking algorithm computes an inner product of the feature value vector and the weight vector.
Changing an action means to change the weight vector for the ranking features.
- Reward. We design the rewards by considering not only purchase behaviors but also other user behaviors. If a click happens, there is a positive reward of 1. If there is no purchase nor click, a negative reward of −1 is received. If a user leaves the page without buying any product, there is a negative reward of −5.

- Baseline models: Empirical weights, learning to Rank
- No code
- Performance is measured in terms of the GMV gap in both search scenarios. 

#### **DJ-MC: A Reinforcement-Learning Agent for Music Playlist Recommendation**. Elad Liebman, Maytal Saar-Tsechansky, Peter Stone. AAMAS 2015. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.1880.pdf)

- Formulate the selecting which sequence of songs to play as a Markov Decision Process, and demonstrate the potential effectiveness of a reinforcement-learning based approach in a new practical domain
- DJ-MC is able to generate personalized song sequences within a single listening session of just 25–50 songs.
- Playlist are of the length `k`
- Finite set of `n` musical tracks
- States - ordered sequence set of songs played
- Actions - next song to play
- Reward - utility of listeners pleasure hearing song `a` in state `s`. Divide into two types of rewards - reward function over song and reward function over transition.
- Deterministic transition function P 
- The agent must internally represent states and actions in such a way that enables generalization of the listener’s preferences
- Use descriptors for song representations. Each song can be factored as a vector of scalar descriptors that reflect details about the
spectral fingerprint of the song, its rhythmic characteristics, its overall loudness, and their change over time.
- To represent different listener types, we generate 10 different playlist clusters by using k-means clustering on the
playlists
- Used Million Song Dataset and Yes.com and Last.fm dataset for experimenting setup
-  For each experiment, we sample a 1000-song corpus from the Million Song Dataset.
- Architecture contains of two components: learning the listeners parameters and planning sequence of the songs
- Use tree-search heuristic for planning
-  It repeats this process as many times as possible, finding the randomly generated trajectory which yields the highest expected payoff
- Compare agent towards two alternative baselines: random choice and greedy algorithm that always plays the song with highest song rewards. 

#### **DRN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for News Recommendation**. Guanjie Zheng, Fuzheng Zhang, Zihan Zheng, Yang Xiang, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Xing Xie, Zhenhui Li. WWW 2018. [paper](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~gjz5038/paper/www2018_reinforceRec/www2018_reinforceRec.pdf)

- In order to better model the dynamic nature of news characteristics and user preference, propose to use Deep Q-Learning (DQN) framework
- Consider user return as another form of user feedback information, by maintaining an activeness score for each user
- Apply a Dueling Bandit Gradient Descent (DBGD) method for exploration by choosing random item candidates in the neighborhood of the current recommender. Can avoid using totally unrelated items. The baseline for exploration: epsilon-greedy and upper confidence bound.
The agent generates a recommendation list L using current network Q and another list L~ using explore network Q~. The parameters W~ can be obtained by adding small noise to W. Then with a  probabilistic interleave to generate the merged recommendation list L^ using L and L~. 
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8243154/88315130-dd2ccd00-cd50-11ea-969a-665af3c62148.png">


- News recommendation system: 
  - 1) content-based systems that maintain news term-frequency and user profile (based on historical news). Then the recommender select the one that is the most similar 
  - 2) collaborative filtering models - utilize past ratings of current user or similar users. 
  - 3) combination of these two
- Challenges: 1) online learning are needed due to the highly dynamic nature of news characteristics and user preference 2) click / no click labels will not capture full feedback towards news. 3) traditional recommender methods tend to recommend similar items and will narrow down user's choice.
- Multi-layer DQN is used to predict the reward
- Push: In each timestamp (t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, ...), when a user sends a news request to the system, the recommendation agent G will take the feature representation of the current user and news candidates as input, and generate a top-k list of news to recommend L. L is generated by combining the exploitation of current model and exploration of novel items
- Feedback: User u who has received recommended news L will give their feedback B by his clicks on this set of news.
- Minor update: After each timestamp with the feature representation of the previous user U and new list L, the feedback B, agent G will update the model by comparing the recommender performance of exploitation network Q and exploration network Q~. If Q~ gives better result the current network will be updated towards Q~.
- Major update: After certain period of time agent G will use the feedback B and user activeness stored in the memory to update the network Q. When each update happens, agent G will sample a batch of records to update the model. Major updates happens after a certain time interval. 
- Feature construction: 
  - News features: OHE features that describe whether a certain property appears in this piece of news
  - User features: mainly describes the features (i.e., headline, provider, ranking, entity name, category, and topic category)
of the news that the user clicked in 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 year respectively
  - User new features: the interaction between user and one certain piece of news, i.e., the frequency for the entity (also category, topic category and provider) to appear in the history of the user’s readings
  - Context features: the context when a news request happens, including time, weekday, and the freshness of the news 
- State features: User features and context features
- Action features: User new features and context features
- Divide the Q-function into value function V (s) and advantage function A(s, a), whereV (s) is only determined by the state features,
and A(s, a) is determined by both the state features and the action features

#### **Recommendations with Negative Feedback via Pairwise Deep Reinforcement Learning**. Xiangyu Zhao, Liang Zhang, Zhuoye Ding, Long Xia, Jiliang Tang, Dawei Yin. KDD 2018. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06501.pdf)

- Collaborative filtering and content-based models may fail given the dynamic nature of user's preferences. The current RL systems designed to maximize the short-term rewards
- Propose a framework DEERS to model positive and negative feedback simultaneously.
- State space: Browsing history of user before time t
- Action space: Recommend items to a user at time t. 
- Rewards: immediate reward (click, skip and etc)
- Transition probability - probability of state transition from <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_{t} -> s_{t+1})">
- Discount factor - factor to measure the present value of future response
- USe DQN ads a base for DEERS model. Instead of just concatinating clicked/ordered items as a positive state s+, introduced the RNN with a GRU architecture to capture user's sequential preferences. Feed positive inputs and negative inputs separately as an input layer. Separate first hidden layers 
- Add regularization term to maximize the difference between the target and competitor items
- Utilized the experienced replay and introduced separated evaluation and target networks, which can help smooth the learning and
avoid the divergence of of parameters
- Closed dataset on JD.com data
- Select MAP and NDCG@40 as a key metrics to evaluate the data

#### **Top-K Off-Policy Correction for a REINFORCE Recommender System**. Minmin Chen, Alex Beutel, Paul Covington, Sagar Jain, Francois Belletti, Ed H. Chi. WSDM 2019. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02353.pdf), [video](https://youtu.be/Ys3YY7sSmIA)

- Leverage on a policy-based algorithm, REINFORCE.
- Live experiment on Youtube data.
- State - user interest, context
- Action - items available for recommendations. Constrain by sampling each item according to the softmax policy.
- Reward - clicks, watch time. As the recommender system lists the page of k-items to a user in time, the expected reward of a set equal to the sum of an expected reward of each item in the set.
- Discount rate - the trade-off between an immediate reward and long-term reward
- Rely on the logged feedback of auctions chosen by a historical policy (or a mixture of policies) as it's not possible to perform online updates of the policy.
- Model state transition with a recurrent neural network (tested LSTM, GRU, Chaos Free RNN) <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_{t+1} = f(s_t, u_{a_t})"> 
- Feedback is biased by previous recommender. Policy not update frequently that also cause bias. Feedback could come from other agents in production.
- Agent is refreshed every 5 days
- Used target (on-policy) and behavioral policy (off-policy) to downweitgth non-target policies.
- The epsilon-greedy policy is not acceptable for Youtube as it causes inappropriate recommendations and bad user experience. Employ Boltzman exploration.
- Target policy is trained with weighted softmax to max long term reward.
- Behavior policy trained using state/action pairs from logged behavior/feedback.
- On an online experiment, the reward is aggregated on a time horizon of 4-10 hours.
- Parameters and architecture are primarily shared.
- RNN is used to represent the user state
- Private dataset
- Code reproduction by Bayes group [code] (https://github.com/awarebayes/RecNN)

- State S - ordered sequence of historical tasks
- Actions - the subset of k items chosen by a recommender from list to display to the user. Actions are represent the subsets of all sets of k items of the total item space I at time t.
- State transition - the user behavior model which returns the transition probability for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_{t+1} = f(s_t, u_{a_t})"> given the previous state <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_{t}"> and the set of items A to display to the system.

#### **Reinforcement Learning to Optimize Long-term User Engagement in Recommender Systems**. Lixin Zou, Long Xia, Zhuoye Ding, Jiaxing Song, Weidong Liu, Dawei Yin. KDD 2019. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05570.pdf)
- Introduced an RL framework - FeedRec to optimize long-term user engagement. Based on Q-network which designed in hierarchical LSTM and S-network, that simulates the environment 
- S-network assists Q-Network and voids the instability of convergence in policy learning. Specifically, in each round of recommendations, aligning with the user feedback, S-network generates the user's response, the dwell time, the revisited time, and flag that indicates that the user will leave or not the platform.
- The model versatile both instant (cliks, likes, ctr) and delayed (dweel time, revisit and etc)
- Trained on internal e-commerce dataset with pre-trained embeddings, which is learned through modeling user's cliking streams with skip-gram.
- State - the user's browsing history
- Action - the finite space of items
- Transition - probability of seeing state <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_{t+1}"> after taking action <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i_t"> at  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_t"> 
- Reward as a weighted sum of different metrics. Give some instantiations of reward function, both instant and delayed metrics.
- The primary user behaviors, such as clicks, skip, the purchase is tracked separately with different LSTM pipelines as where different user's behavior is captured by the corresponding LSTM-layer to avoid intensive behavior dominance and capture specific characteristics.

- Instead of training reinforcement learning in Taobao directly, we present our approach: first build Virtual Taobao, a simulator learned from historical customer behavior data through the proposed GAN-SD (GAN for Simulating Distributions) and MAIL (multi-agent adversaria limitation learning), and then we train policies in Virtual Taobao with no physical costs in which ANC (Action Norm Constraint) strategy is proposed to reduce over-fitting.
- Comparing with the traditional supervised learning approach, the strategy trained in Virtual Taobao achieves more than 2% improvement of revenue in the real environment.
- Agent - the search engine
- Environment - the customers
- Commodity search and shopping process can see as a sequential decision process. Customers decision process for engine and customers. The engine and customers are the environments of each other

- The DRR framework treats recommendations as a sequential decision making procedure and adopts "Actor-critic" reinforcement-learning scheme to model interactions between the user and recommender items. The framework treats recommendations as a sequential decision-making process, which consider both immediate and long-term reward.

- State - User's positive interaction history with recommender as well as her demographic situation.
- Actions - continuous parameter vector a. Each item has a ranking score, which is defined as the inner product of the action and the item embedding.
- Transitions - once the user's feedback is collected the transition is determined
- Reward - clicks, rates, etc
- Discount rate - the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term reward

<img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8243154/84734575-edab9400-afa9-11ea-8199-4f4a1b34b7d9.png">

- Developed three state-representation models:
  - DRR-p Utilize the product operator to capture the pairwise local dependencies between items. Compute pairwise interactions between items by using the element-wise product operations.
  - DRR-u In addition to local dependencies between items, the pairwise interactions of user-item are also taken into account.
  - DRR-ave. Average pooling over DRR-p. The resulting vector is leveraged to model the interactions with the input user. Finally, concat the interaction vector and embedding of the user. On offline evaluation, DRR-ave outperformed DRR-p and DRR-u.

- Epsilon-greedy exploration in the Actor-network.
- Evaluated on offline datasets (MovieLens, Yahoo! Music, Jester)
- Online evaluation with environment simulator. Pretrain PMF (probabilistic matrix factorization) model as an environment simulator.

- Developed a SLATEQ, a decomposition of value-based temporal-difference and Q-learning that renders RL tractable with slates
- LTV of a slate can be decomposed into a tractable value function of its component item-wise LTV
- Introduced a recommender simulation environment, RecSim that allows the straightforward configuration of an item collection (or vocabulary), a user (latent) state model and a user choice model.
- Session optimization
- State - static users features as demographics, declared interests, user context, summarizaiton of the previous history
- Actions - the set of all possible slates.
- Transition probability
- Reward - measurement of user engagement. 
- In the MDP model each user should be viewed as a separate environment or separate MDP. Hence it critical to allow generalization across users, since few if any users generates enough experience to allow reasonable recommendations.
- Combinatorial optimizaton problem - find the slate with the maximum Q-value. SlateQ allows to decompose into combination of the item-wise Q-values of the consistent items. Tried top-k, greedy, LP-based methods.
- Items and user interests as a topic modeling problem
- As a choice model, use an exponential cascade model that accounts for document position in the slate. This choice model assumes "attention" is given to one document at a time, with exponentially decreasing attention given to documents as a user moves down the slate.
- A user choice model impacts which document(if any) from the slate is consumed by the user. Made an assumption that a user can observe any recommender document's topic before selection but can't observe its quality before consumption
- Users interested in document d defines the relative document appeal to the user and serves the basis of the choice function.
- Models are trained periodically and pushed to the server. The ranker uses the latest model to recommend items and logs user feedback, which is used to train new models. Using LTV labels, iterative model training, and pushing can be viewed as a form of generalized policy iteration.
- A candidate generator retrieves a small subset (hundreds) of items from a large corpus that best matches a user context. The ranker scores/ranks are candidates using a DNN with both user context and item features as input. It optimizes a combination of several objectives (e.g., clicks, expected engagement, several other factors).

- RECSIM is a configurable platform that allows the natural, albeit abstract, specification of an environment in which a recommender interacts with a corpus of documents (or recommendable items) and a set of users, to support the development of recommendation algorithms.
- The user model samples users from a prior distribution over (configurable) user features: these may include latent features
such as personality, satisfaction, interests; observable features such as demographics; and behavioral features such as session length, visit frequency, or time budget
- The document model samples items from a prior over document features, which again may incorporate latent features such as document quality, and observable features such as topic, document length and global statistics (e.g., ratings, popularity)
- User response is determined by user choice model. Once the document is consumed the user state undergoes a transition through a configurable (user) transition model
- The user model assumes that user have a various degrees of interests in topic (with some prior distribution) ranking from -1 to 1.

- RECSIM offers stackable hierarchical agent layers intended to solve a more abstract recommendation problem. A hierarchical agent layer does not materialize a slate of documents (i.e., RS action), but relies on one or more base agents to do so.
- RECSIM can be viewed as a dynamic Bayesian network that defines a probability distribution over trajectories of slates, choices, and observations.
- Several baseline agents implemented:
  - TabularQAgent - Q-learning algorithm. Enumarates all possible slates to maximize over Q values
  - Full-slateQAgent - deep Q-Network agent by threating each slate as a single action
  - Random agent - random slates with no duplicates
